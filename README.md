# PowerBI-Data-Visualization-Report-for-Waggle

# Waggle, is a startup that makes smart devices, a fitness collar for dogs, that lets owners track their 
dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas.
# I worked on delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the new 
Lapcat device data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices.
# I used bookmarks, slicers pane, and navigation buttons, to maintain an interactive report.
